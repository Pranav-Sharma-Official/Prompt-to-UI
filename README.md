## 🧠 How It Works

Prompt-to-UI uses pattern matching to interpret your text descriptions and convert them into UI components. It recognizes certain keywords and phrases to determine what components to generate and how they should be styled.

### Example Prompts

- "Create a button with label 'Submit'"
- "Add a form with submit button 'Sign Up'"
- "Make a card with title 'Features' and content 'Our product has amazing features'"
- "Add a navbar with title 'My App'"
- "Create a hero section with title 'Welcome' and subtitle 'Join us today'"

## 🎨 Customization

You can customize the components by including specific properties in your prompts:

- **Buttons**: Specify the label text
- **Inputs**: Set the placeholder text
- **Cards**: Define the title and content
- **Forms**: Change the submit button text
- **Hero sections**: Set the title, subtitle, and button text

## 📱 Responsive Design

Prompt-to-UI is built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring that all generated components look great on any device size, from mobile phones to large desktop monitors.

## 🔮 Future Plans

- Add more component types (modals, sidebars, pagination, alerts)
- Implement more advanced natural language processing
- Add component drag and drop functionality
- Support for more design variations (Material Design, iOS style)
- Export components as reusable code snippets
